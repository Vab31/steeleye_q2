This function accepts three parameters:

htmlContent: The original HTML content to be highlighted.

plainText: The highlighted plain text.

plainTextPositions: An array of objects reflecting the plain text's start and finish positions in the plainText.

The function loops through plainTextPositions positions, extracting the start and finish positions. The beginning and closing HTML tag strings are then prepared for highlighting.



What happens inside the loop is as follows:



The variables openingTagOffset and closingTagOffset are set to begin and end, respectively. These are the positions in the highlightedHtml where the beginning and closing highlight tags will be added.

This function takes three arguments:

htmlContent: This is the original HTML content that will be highlighted.

plainText: The plain text that has been highlighted.

plainTextPositions: An array of objects representing the start and end points of the plain text in the plainText.

The function iterates over plainTextPositions positions, obtaining the start and end locations. The beginning and ending HTML tag strings are then highlighted.



Inside the loop, the following happens:



The openingTagOffset and closingTagOffset variables are set to begin and finish, respectively. These are the highlightedHtml places where the opening and ending highlight tags will be inserted.

If both openingTagOffset and closingTagOffset are valid (not -1), the method alters highlightedHtml. The original highlightedHtml file is divided into three sections:

The function modifies highlightedHtml if both openingTagOffset and closingTagOffset are valid (not -1). It divides the original highlightedHtml file into three sections:


The test cases use your testing framework's expect function (such as Jest) to determine whether the actual output of the highlightHTMLContent function matches the expected output. 
These test cases ensure that the function performs as intended when highlighting plain text in various points within the HTML page.

Keep in mind that, while this method and the given test cases appear to work for simple circumstances, it may not handle more complex scenarios or edge cases correctly. 
When working with HTML manipulation, it is critical to explore all options and properly test the solution with a variety of inputs.
